# VioMedia

## I couldn't come up with a better name

**VioMedia is a media server that I have been developing for the past couple months. VioMedia is free and open source and is available under the GNU GPL-3.0 License.**

If there are issues with my code (which I'm sure there is) feel free to raise an issue. I would greatly appreciate it as it helps me as a programmer.

## How to run

### From source

`git clone https://github.com/TheGreatViolet/viomedia.git`

`cd viomedia`

`npm install`

`npm test`

### From build

Coming soon ;)
