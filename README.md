# VioMedia

## I couldn't come up with a better name

**VioMedia is a media server that I have been developing for the past couple months. VioMedia is free and open source and is available under the GNU GPL-3.0 License.**

If there are issues with my code (which I'm sure there is) feel free to raise an issue. I would greatly appreciate it as it helps me as a programmer.

## How to run

### From source

`git clone https://github.com/TheGreatViolet/viomedia.git`

`cd viomedia`

`npm install`

`npm run`

### From build

Coming soon ;)

## How to open

Viomedia will log the address you can access Viomedia on in the console (example `10.0.0.37:3000`). From there you can copy and paste that address into your browser to access Viomedia

## How to add media

By default Viomedia has the media directory set to the `media` folder in the root directory of the application if you're running from source. Add media to that directory and refresh your browser window in order to see the changes.

### How to add a custom directory

Click on the `settings` tab at the top of the Viomedia window in your browser. From there you can type a custom path to the directory with your media in it.
